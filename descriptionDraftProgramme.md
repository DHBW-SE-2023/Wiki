### Topic: **YAAC - Yet Another Attendance Checker**

### General description:
At present, attendance at each course at the DHBW Friedrichshafen is checked by means of a written list of participants. Each student must sign the relevant line. The completed lists are then sent to the DHBW Friedrichshafen office by each course spokesperson. Once all the lists have been received, each list must be manually checked for completeness.
It is precisely this process that we are trying to address with the development of a full stack application. The aim of the application is to relieve the secretariat of the DHBW Friedrichshafen of the task of checking the "participant lists". The application analyses all signatures on the attendance lists and provides the user with an overview of the attendance. In addition, the user is given the possibility to intervene independently in exceptional cases, as well as a statistical overview of absences by means of a database.

### Customer Requirements

- easy to use
- performance
- fast executability
- runs locally
- reliability

### Professional Environment
- fullstack web development
- image processing
- security of sensible data
- DSGVO

### Usage, Outlook
As already mentioned, the application will initially be used in the secretariat of the DHBW Friedrichshafen. The aim is to reduce the workload on staff by automating the time-consuming, manual checking of the "participant lists". This will free up capacity and allow them to focus on more important tasks.
In the future, with the approval of the DHBW, the current programme could be extended to include authentic signature recognition, which would be able to check signatures for correctness. With this extension, the DHBW could extend signature verification to all other DHBW locations, thus providing far-reaching workload reduction.
