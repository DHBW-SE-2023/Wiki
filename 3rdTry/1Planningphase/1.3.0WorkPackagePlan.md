# Work Package Plan

Creation of singular work packages based on [requirement specification](/3rdTry/1Planningphase/1.2RequirementSpecification.md)

Each Work Package is described through:

## Index

- defined result
- effort
- preconditions
- duration

Dependencies between work packages logically create a network diagram.

-> sequential processing necessary -> critical project path

-> possibility of parallelization
