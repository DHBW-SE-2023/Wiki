# Project Manual/Definition of Done

## Guidelines

### Coding Guidelines

Most of the Coding Guidelines are automatically implemented in Go.

- Code indentation
- variable names: self-explained variable names
- Naming Conventions!!! (needs to be described in a more detailed way)
- Max 30 lines per function



## Process Model

YAAC's process model is [Kanban](https://kanbanguides.org/english/). The Kanban board can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/DHBW-SE-2023/projects/1). 

Our Definition of Workflow is the following:

Work items are implemented as issues in the Kanban board. Usually they are written into the backlog. If the issue will be adressed in the next sprint, it will be dragged into the column "Todo". There a developer can assign themselves to the issue or they can be assigned to it by another person. If the assigned person started working on the issue, it will be dragged into "In Progress". After finishing the work on it, the assignee moves it into "Done" where the issue can be closed and moved into "Previous" at last. The issue closing will be done in the weekly scrum meeting.

The other part of our process model consists of agile methods. We welcome changing requirements, as we adjust them to the best outcome for the user. To do so, we meet up at least once a week to review the issues done during that week and discuss what we plan on developing the next week.

Steps of Process:

- Email integration
- Image Processing
- User interface
- Database

## Email Integration

A user sends an email to the secretary's office. As the project runs in the background, YAAC detects the new mail as an attendance list by checking the subject of the mail which contains specific phrases like "Anwesenheitsliste", "Anwesenheit", "Liste". If one of these phrases has been found, YAAC checks if the mail has an image as attachment. The image in the attachment will be extracted and send to the image processing module.

## Image Processing

This module accepts the image from mail integration and analyzes its contents. The image must contain a table with two columns. The column on the left entails the students's names in alphabetical order. The column on the right is the place where the signatures should be located.   

## User Interface

## Database

## Quality Management

- Accuracy: Ensuring that the system accurately identifies and extracts signatures from images of attendance sheets. This involves implementing robust image processing algorithms and machine learning models to minimize errors and false positives/negatives.
- Reliability: Consistently providing reliable results in determining attendance. YAAC should be able to handle various types of attendance sheets and signatures with a high level of reliability, regardless of factors such as image quality or handwriting variability.
- Efficiency: Optimizing the system's performance to process attendance sheets quickly and efficiently. This includes minimizing processing time and resource usage while maintaining accuracy and reliability.
- Usability: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. The interface should make it easy for users to upload attendance images, view results and modify them if neccessary.
- Security: The data stored in the database should be protected by security measures.
- Compliance: YAAC has to comply with GDPR.
- Documentation: Documenting the entire project entirely and understandably. This includes the project management documentation, the user documentation and the [developmental documentation](https://github.com/DHBW-SE-2023/YAAC/tree/master/docs) using [GoDoc](/3rdTry/GoDoc.md).


## Configuration Management

Configuration management for YAAC involves the systematic management of the software's configuration items, including its codebase, dependencies, settings, and documentation. The primary goals of configuration management are to:

- Version Control and Documentation Management: [YAAC](https://github.com/DHBW-SE-2023) is managed as an organisation on github. Both the documentation and the project itself are tracked there.
<font color = red>
- Build Management: The build should be done as easy as possible. Therefore, the deployable product should have as few external dependencies as possible.
</font>
- Change Management: A process for requesting, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes to the software should be established. The final github pipeline is described [here](/3rdTry/Pipeline.md).
- Release Management: Coordinate the planning, scheduling, and deployment of software releases. This involves ensuring that releases are properly tested, documented, and packaged for distribution to users.
