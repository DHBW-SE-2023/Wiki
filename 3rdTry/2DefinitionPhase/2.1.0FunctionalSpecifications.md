# 1. Definition of Goals

This section defines the criteria YAAC has to accomplish. By differentiating between obligatory and desirably criteria, it is made clear which of them are essential goals for the project and which are somewhat "nice-to-have". There also will be a separation of criteria that YAAC does not wish to fulfill. Therefore, the set limitations of are marked out.

## 1.1 Obligatory Criteria

The following criteria has to be implicated as they ensure the YAAC's stable use. If one of them does not work, YAAC cannot be used reliably. 

### Mail Integration

The mail integration must work reliably. 

## 1.2 Desirably Criteria

As tis section's criteria is not needed for assuring a reliable app usage, it will not necessarily be implemented into YAAC. However, their implementation would benefit YAAC's user experience.

## 1.3 Differentiation/Separation of Criteria

YAAC does not aim for replacing neither the human at the workplace nor the whole attendance checking process. It is seen as a complement to the current attendance checking workflow to improve its effectivity.
