# 1. Definition of Goals

This section defines the criteria YAAC has to accomplish. By differentiating between obligatory and desirably criteria, it is made clear which of them are essential goals for the project and which are somewhat "nice-to-have". There also will be a separation of criteria that YAAC does not wish to fulfill. Therefore, the set limitations of are marked out.

## 1.1 Obligatory Criteria

The following criteria has to be implicated as they ensure the YAAC's stable use. If one of them does not work, YAAC cannot be used reliably. 

### General

As YAAC is supposed to replace a boring part of the attendance-check-process, it needs to be easy to use without any over complex features. The application has to have a settings page in which various settings and alterations can be implemented in a precise manner. 
The program performance should not influence normal system operation. It also needs to run locally on the computer (?) and it has to be able to keep its process automatically alive while working in the background so that mails can detected at all time. YAAC was built as an open source project, which is why it is important to fulfill all requirements of an open source license. The license does not necessarily have to be a specific one.

### Mail Integration

The mail integration must work reliably.

### Image Processing

Image processing needs to run reliably. As the user usually will trust on the program's output, image processing should have a convincing accuracy. It also needs to display all kinds of edge cases so that the user can decide the final outcome.

### HMI

The HMI is an user interface. YAAC is available as an application for desktop systems (WHAT KINDS?). The UI has fixed [design guidelines](/Pages/FrontendDesignguidelines.md) and needs a clear structure and a simple handling. The user experience should be good. The lists should be shown both as original picture and as analyzed picture. The missing names should be visualized directly so that the most important information is easily accessible. 

## 1.2 Optional Criteria

As tis section's criteria is not needed for assuring a reliable app usage, it will not necessarily be implemented into YAAC. However, their implementation would benefit YAAC's user experience.

### General

Some sort of user documentation would be helpful. As it is a prototype, there exists no experience of how to handle the app the best, therefore a help-page in the program would be beneficial. As YAAC is supposed to be easy to use, it should be only an optional criteria tho.

## 1.3 Differentiation/Separation of Criteria

YAAC does not aim for replacing neither the human at the workplace nor the whole attendance checking process. It is seen as a complement to the current attendance checking workflow to improve its effectivity.
