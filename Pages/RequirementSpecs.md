# Requirement Specifications

## General Description
Currently, the attendance check for each course at the DHBW Friedrichshafen is carried out via a written list of participants. Each student must sign the relevant line. The completed lists are then sent to the secretary's office by designated students. As soon as all lists have been received, each list is checked manually for completeness.

This is precisely the process we are addressing with the development of our full-stack application. The application's goal is to support the secretary's office by checking the "participant lists" automatically. All signatures on the participant lists are analyzed, and the user is provided with an overview of attendance. In addition, the user is given the opportunity to intervene directly in exceptional cases, as well as a statistical overview of attendance using a database.

## Usage & Outlook
As already indicated, the application will initially be used in the secretariat of the DHBW Friedrichshafen. This should reduce the workload on the staff by automating the time-consuming, manual checking of the "participant lists". This will free up capacities and allow the staff to focus on more important tasks.

In the future, with the approval of the DHBW, the current programme could be extended to include authentic signature recognition, which would be able to check signatures for correctness. With this extension, the DHBW could extend signature verification to all other DHBW locations, thus providing far-reaching workload reduction.
