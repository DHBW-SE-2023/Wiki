# Requirement Specifications

## General Description
Currently, the attendance check for each course at the DHBW Friedrichshafen is carried out via a written list of participants. Each student must sign the relevant line. The completed lists are then sent to the secretary's office by designated students. As soon as all lists have been received, each list is checked manually for completeness.
This is precisely the process we are addressing with the development of a full-stack application. The application's goal is to support the secretary's office by checking the "participant lists" automatically. All signatures on the participant lists are analyzed, and the user is provided with an overview of attendance. In addition, the user is given the opportunity to intervene directly in exceptional cases, as well as a statistical overview of attendance using a database.
