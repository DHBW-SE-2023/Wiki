# Unit Tests

As mentioned in [5.1.0 Testing Strategy](./5.1.0TestingStrategy.md) **Unit Tests** are preferred if possible. unfortunately only parts of the software could effectively be tested this way. In the **Mailclient** only the connection could be tested this way which leads to a test **coverage** of **13.4%**. The **Database** is comprehensively tested using Unit Tests as most of its functions can be used atomically which leads to a **coverage** of **82.3%**.
