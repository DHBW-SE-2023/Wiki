# Known Issues

## No full cross platform compatibility in with single executable file
Initially the decision for the used architecture and technologies were made on the promise of cross plattform compatibility, OS and hardware abstraction and the need of only one executable. Unfortunately the GOCV dependency could not be statically linked and thus not shipped in the same executable file which means it is not trivial to install and might need additional permissions. For this reason a container was chosen as the option for windows PCs.

## Container not running on every platform
The container fails to run on some Linux distributions and Mac OS this is possibly caused by X-Server permissions but could not be fixed yet. Which lets leaves only Windows as officially supported platform. Fortunately the university administration endusers in Germany are running Windows.
