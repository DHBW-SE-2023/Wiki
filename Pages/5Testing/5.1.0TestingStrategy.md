# Testing Strategy

The testing strategy is to use the most appropriate test for a specific component of the software. 

**Unit Tests** were the best way for most backend components especially the **Database** as those functions are mostly atomic. 

**Image Processing** is tested using **Component Tests** as it is not meant be be used atomic but as a whole. 

The **Mailclient** is dependant on the external mail server and side effects of the users mails and thus can not be completely unit tested but relies on manual user tests. This is also true for the **Frontend** as it relies on the users interaction and previously entered data as well as the mail integrations activity.
