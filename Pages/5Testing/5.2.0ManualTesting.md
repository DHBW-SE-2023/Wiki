# Manual Tests

As mentioned in [5.1.0 Testing Strategy](./5.1.0TestingStrategy.md) the **Mailclient** and **Frontend** can not fully be tested with Unit tests as they rely on other systems and side effects. This is why we have manual tests for those and the whole application. 

The team members regularly tests the **dev** branch state and **Pull Requests** on their system. Frontend pages, button presses and user input are tested and with most of the team participating the tests are executed on every common operating system (Linux, MacOS and Windows) as well as a variety of hardware. If problems or errors arise in this stage they are either fixed directly or an issue is created.
