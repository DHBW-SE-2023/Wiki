# Functional Specifications (Pflichtenheft)

## 1. Introduction

YAAC is the application designed to simplify the attendance check at DHBW Friedrichshafen. Automating the secretary's task of checking all signatures of the attendance list, the everyday work is reduced and the secretary's office is less busy and can take care of more important matters. To achieve that, YAAC automatically fetches all relevant email regarding the attendance of students from the mail server and processes the images so that the detected missing students can be reported back to the user. The customer is represented by Mr. KegreiÃŸ.

The project scope is the planning and definition of the project, the conceptual realization followed by the implementation and testing. The release of the application in an app store is not part of the project implementation. The scope of delivery includes an application that runs on both Windows and Linux, the documentation of the individual development phases as well as the necessary diagrams and a user manual.


## 2. General Description

### 2.1 Objective and purpose of the document

This document is used to document all functional and non-functional requirements that must be fulfilled in order for the project to be considered successful. It is also used for quality assurance and as a communication document between the developer and customer to record the implementation in text form and avoid misunderstandings. It also provides a certain legal basis if the project is not completed according to the customer's wishes.

### 2.2 Project reference and dependencies

The project is self-contained and does not contain any dependencies on other projects. Additional functionalities, such as the installation of a mail server are not included in the implemented basic product, which also means that there are no dependencies on third parties.

### 2.3 Abbreviations

- UI: User Interface
- YAAC: Yet Another Attendance Checker

### 2.4 Teams and third party involvement

The development team works independently on the development and implementation of the project. There are no further dependencies on third parties.

### 2.5 Obligatory Criteria

As YAAC is supposed to replace a part of the attendance-check-process, it needs to be easy to use without any over complex features. The application has to have a settings page in which various settings and alterations can be implemented in a precise manner. 
The program performance should not influence normal system operation. It also needs to run completely local on the computer and it has to be able to keep its process automatically alive while working in the background so that mails can detected at all time. YAAC was built as an open source project, which is why it is important to fulfill all requirements of an open source license. The license does not necessarily have to be a specific one.

## 2.6 Differentiation/Separation of Criteria

YAAC does not not aim for replacing neither the human at the workplace nor the whole attendance checking process. Its goal is to automate the repetitive task of fetching the images of the attendance lists from the emails, sent by the spokespersons of the different courses, and checking if a signature of a given student is missing. This is currently done manually. To achieve this, YAAC runs locally on a computer to mitigate data protection regulations and it provides a user interface to allow fast corrections and overviews of the fetched attendance lists. It is seen as a complement to the current attendance checking workflow to improve its efficiency and effectivity. Since we have not been given access to the DHBW's internal webmail client and we are not allowed or able to connect Dualis, YAAC has no integrations with other systems, which would mean complete automation of the attendance lists. 


## 3. Concept and general conditions

### 3.1 Field of Application

YAAC was specifically designed for the usage at the computer science department of the university DHBW Ravensburg Campus Friedrichshafen, as the attendance checking process is quite specific. Therefore YAAC is only suitable for a limited field of application. After further development of the image processing unit, it is also possible to include other secretariats from other departments.


### 3.2 System requirements

The host operating system is Windows 10/11 and virtualization is enabled. Furthermore Docker (and maybe Docker Desktop) should be installed using WSL2 as the virtualization software.


## 4. Product Overview

The following diagram describes the use cases of the project and therefore the general features YAAC offers to the users.

![Use Case Diagram](/Diagrams/Images/UseCaseDiagram.png)

# 5. Product Functions

The following subitems go into detail about all functions that were mentioned in the specifications.


### 5.1 Functional Requirements

### 5.1.1 Email integration

The user should enter the email login details for the email address to which the lists are sent. Then, triggered either by a button or triggered automatically in the background, the mail is retrieved and checked to see if there are any new mails with lists. The images are then extracted from the lists, analyzed and entered into the database. Finally, all processed mails are marked as read.

### 5.1.2 Image processing

The image processing should recognize the sheet of paper on the image and the table on it. The rows and columns are recognized based on this. The printed text is recognized in the left-hand column, while the valid signature fields are recognized in the right-hand column. There must be exactly one signature in this signature field to fulfill the requirements. The list of student names is exported with the information as to whether a valid signature is present.

Image processing requires a certain layout of the attendance list. The photo must contain a table with three columns, whereby the first column only numbers the course participants and therefore is kept small. The second column contains the names of the course participants in the following format: last name, first name, middle name. The third column is for the signatures. These are to be written with a document-proof pen.
The top line contains the course name and the course abbreviation (e.g.: Informationstechnik TIT22) in the left, and the date, the room and the lecturer in the right-hand column.
The bottom lines remain blank if the course table does not need the whole page.
Below the table, which extends over the entire sheet, there is a framed footer. However, this typed paragraph is irrelevant for image recognition as it always contains the same information and is not of particular importance. An example list can be found in the project YAAC.

### 5.1.3 User interface

YAAC implements the user face that is described in [8. User Interface](#8-user-interface). It is easy to read and use. The requirements are also described in [9. User Interface](#9-user-interface).


### 5.2 Nonfunctional Requirements

The following chapter describes the features from the requirement specifications in detail.


### 5.2.1 Document management

All files and documents belonging to the project can be found in the git organization called [YAAC](https://github.com/DHBW-SE-2023). The team creates a Wiki to collect all documents and information in order to provide all project participants with a good overview of all content.
This should be structured according to the respective phases of the development process and clearly laid out to make it easier to find the necessary information, documents or diagrams.


### 5.2.2 Version control

As mentioned above, the project uses Git for version management, and the service GitHub is used as location to store the files at. As result, the source code of the application can be managed and its development can be tracked clearly. 


### 5.2.3 Project conventions

To ensure consistent work with uniformly documented results, conventions are introduced for source code, version management and documentation. To enforce coding styles, the project uses both Staticcheck and Sonar. How exactly they are implemented and used can be looked up reading [this issue](https://github.com/DHBW-SE-2023/YAAC/issues/65)

### 5.2.4 Platform independency

YAAC requires either a combination of WSL and docker or a Linux distribution combined with Docker and either X11 or XWayland.

## 6. Product Data

YAAC saves the analyzed data in a database. The attributes saved there are the following: 
- list (image)
- date
- course
- student names
- status of attendance

A more specific description of how the data is stored in the database can be found [here](/Pages/3Design/3.3.0BuildingBlockView.md)


## 7. Product Performance

The program's GUI should be responsive and react quickly to user input. Furthermore its graphical interface should be learned easily.
Tasks that take longer, like the image processing for example, are run in the background and the user is only informed if they are completed or if they fail.

The image processing may take a longer time of up to (ideally) one minute, though it is fine if it takes longer than that, as the user is not actively waiting for it to complete.


## 8. Quality Requirements

The data that is stored are the names and signatures of the students. This data can be considered private information and is therefore only stored locally on the user's PC.
The attendance list processing should confidently (> 95%) identify the students names. The signature validation does not have as strict constraints, as signatures are difficult to validate, as every person has their own unique version. More than 75% of signatures should be validated correctly.


## 9. User Interface

The project implements the in [2.3.0PrototypeUI](/Pages/2Definition/2.3.0PrototypeUI.md) described UI design. The text size is easy to read and all in all, the UI is easy to use. For simple and quick navigation through the different views, a navigation bar menu is implemented on the left side of the screen. All views are linked there which serves as an overview of all views. The views and their functions are described in the following.


### 9.1 Home View

The home view is the main page of the application. It presents an overview of all computer science courses, for each of which it is noted whether a list has already been received from today or not. If a list already exists, the students concerned are displayed directly in the fields in the event of an absence. The user should also be able to enter a list manually from the home view. The courses themselves are implemented in such a way that they navigate the user to the respective course on the course view page with a click.


### 9.2 Course View

The course view shows a detailed view of the selected course. The selection of courses is implemented simply using two drop-down menus, one of which determines the year and the other the course.
In the special course view itself, the course list can be seen, with absent students highlighted in red. From there it is also possible to view the original image and the image analyzed by YAAC. If a student subsequently registers as present in the office, the user can change this in the list at a later date. Even in the rare case that the image processing has made a mistake, this can be corrected in the course view.


### 9.3 Settings View

In the settings view, the user can change the settings of the YAAC application, read the general information about YAAC, find the link to the Wiki and to the user manual. 


## 10. Technical Product Environment

The following subitems describe the technical requirements the user's system has to be able to meet in order to run YAAC successfully on their PC.


### 10.1 Software

To run the software on the end-users system `Docker` using WSL2 as virtualization (assuming that the user uses Windows 10/11). No further software should be necessary to install. WSL2 already has the basic capability build in to run X11-aware applications.


### 10.2 Hardware

The computer on which the software is run needs an internet connection and a virtualization capable CPU. The CPU is also recommended to support SIMD instructions, s.t. image processing operations can take advantage of them.


### 10.3 Organizational Limiting Conditions

The existing workflow must be similar to the workflow that is shown in the diagram below in order to be able to use YAAC the way it is supposed to be used. The attendance lists that will be used also have to fulfill a specific setup in order to be read correctly by YAAC's image processing unit.

![WorkflowOld](/Diagrams/Images/WorkflowOldDiagram.png)


### 10.4 Product development interfaces

The interface for maintenance of the database as well as the interface to the email integration are implemented in the settings view.


## 11. Specific requirements for the development environment

There are various specific requirements that have to be met for the development environment. They are described in the following.


### 11.1 Software

To develop the program the operating systems Debian/Ubuntu are recommended. This is because all required packages are available through `apt`. Alternatively Arch Linux can also be used, though there are problems with the Gosseract library finding the `leptonica` library. The program needs to be compiled with the CGO_LDFLAGS accordingly overridden (See https://github.com/DHBW-SE-2023/YAAC/pull/85/commits/8104bc94b70c2832642a4bfef05bcf23f385f7d0 for details).
The following libraries are needed to run the application locally:
```
- OpenCV and OpenCV-Contrib along with the development libraries
- TesseractOCR, development libraries for Tesseract and Tesseract Deu for the data for the German language.
- X11 Server and according libraries need to be installed for the GUI to run.
```
As the application is later shipped using Docker, Docker Desktop should also be installed to test whether this works.
To inspect and debug the database of the application it is also recommended to install `sqlite3`.


### 11.2 Hardware

The suggested operating system to use for development is Debian/Ubuntu. On these systems the required packages for Tesseract OCR and OpenCV are present. If the developer does not wish to install one of these OSes on their hardware it is also possible to use an emulated environment via i.e. WSL2 or VMWare Workstation. Therefore the CPU and host Operating System need to support virtualization.
Furthermore the program can be run in a Docker container on any operating system. If the developer wishes to use this approach, virtualization capabilities are also needed.
A reasonably powerful CPU improves the developer experience, as GoCV needs to compile the C++ bindings each time the program is compiled. The program uses also Tesseract OCR for character recognition, so to run manual tests and the program tests a CPU using SIMD can speed them up.


### 11.3 Organizational Limiting Conditions

As both our time and resources were limited for the project, the application YAAC does not contain all functions that would have been possible to implement but is rather focused on the most important and essential functions to make YAAC a runnable and usable application. As our project is open source and its repository is public on github, everyone is able to further develop the project. As the code is well written and documented, it is easy to understand the current project.

Another limiting condition of our project was that the DBHW could not give us students access neither to the email web server, nor to Dualis - the software where the secretary's office records the student's attendance officially. Therefore we were not able to fully implement our project into the university's attendance workflow.
The workflow improved by YAAC is shown in the following diagram:
![WorkflowNewDiagram](/Diagrams/Images/WorkflowNewDiagram.png)

## 12. Breakdown in Subproducts

There are the following sub-products:

- image processing
- mail integration
- database
- UI

Since the image-processing process is the core element of our project, this is the first to be worked on. At the same time, a mockup of the user interface is created, which already describes and defines the structure of the application.  


##  13 Testing and quality assurance

The system should be extensively tested and checked to ensure its quality. For this purpose, various test procedures are used and carried out on different end-user devices. Details on Testing can be found in Wiki's 5th chapter - [Testing](/Pages/5Testing/5.0.0TestingPhase.md).
