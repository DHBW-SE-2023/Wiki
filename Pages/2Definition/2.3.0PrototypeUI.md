# Prototype UI

## UI mockup

We sat together and thought of different ways of how we should design the user interface. At last, we decided to set up three mockups as we thought YAAC would look best on the frontend level.
The required views are the following: Overview, course and/or student view, home view, statistics view and settings view.

Thus, we created three mockups using Figma.
Figma is a cloud-based design and prototyping tool that allows designers and teams to create, collaborate on, and prototype user interfaces and digital products in real-time. Click on the link first, then on the "play" button in the upper right corner to start the interactive mockups. 

The [first prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/b6sFcATHprQSSewRWA9xKA/Daniel?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=rglTtAia9gVcroWV-1) was discarded as the handling of the app felt more like it was an application for mobile devices and YAAC is intended to be a desktop app.

The [second](https://www.figma.com/file/kEDkmrjFhyWMbR5e0DWAUW/YAAC-UI-Mockup---Max?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=7dDhlSnjUJi1RkDG-1) and [third](https://www.figma.com/file/LafaEbsEgrPlpfGFD248Ht/Eva?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=TOMVQUrePTfY2zOh-1) mockups are quite similar in their structure. As the third mockup looks more appealing for the user, it was chosen for further development and therefore contains all style elements and functionalities that will also be implemented in YAAC. The design is simple and intuitive as an application should be.

Unfortunately, we noticed in the implementation phase, that Fyne does not work well with custom made styles but rather enforces the developers to use Fyne's own style. Therefore, multiple design features like the rounded corners were not possible to implement. The final result resembles both the second and third mockup and thus is a mix of these two.

The intention when creating the design was to focus on the user and their needs. To test this, we gave the mockup to fellow students and friends and observed their usage behavior. In this way, we ensured that this was the focus of the frontend development.

YAAC has a sidebar menu for simple and intuitive navigation. The clear design is continued with clear and descriptive labels for menus and buttons, which helps the user to quickly find what they need.

Button styles, font and colors were declared globally so that the user interface maintains consistency throughout the whole application.

YAAC has a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

The statistics view was not implemented in the final application as it is not essential for the application itself and as time and resources were limited.
