## UI mockup
A working prototype of YAAC's user interface was set up using Fyne. It contains all functionalities the application will have implemented. You can access it through [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/LafaEbsEgrPlpfGFD248Ht/Eva?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=WLknTuXN0PHTvYjs-0).

Unfortunately, we noticed in the implementation phase, that Fyne does not work well with custom made styles but rather enforces the developers to use Fyne's own style. Therefore, multiple design features like the rounded corners were not possible to implement.

The intention when creating the design was to focus on the user and their needs. To test this, we gave the mockup to fellow students and friends and observed their usage behaviour. In this way, we ensured that this was the focus of the frontend development.

YAAC has a sidebar menu for simple and intuitive navigation. The clear design is continued with clear and descriptive labels for menus and buttons, which helps the user to quickly find what they need.

Button styles, font and colors were declared globally so that the user interface maintains consistency throughout the whole application.

YAAC has a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

<!--
User-Centric Design: Put the user at the center of the design process. Understand their needs, preferences, and pain points through user research, surveys, and feedback mechanisms.
Simplify Navigation: Keep the navigation simple and intuitive. Use clear and descriptive labels for menus, buttons, and links. Organize content logically to help users find what they need quickly.
Consistent Interface: Maintain consistency throughout the application interface. Use consistent layouts, colors, fonts, and styles to create a cohesive and familiar user experience across all screens.
Clear Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear visual hierarchy to guide users' attention to the most important elements on the screen. Use size, color, contrast, and spacing to differentiate between different levels of importance.
Minimalism: Embrace minimalism in design to reduce clutter and distractions. Focus on essential elements and remove unnecessary features or information that can overwhelm users.
Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. Prioritize mobile optimization to accommodate users who access the application on smartphones and tablets.
Feedback and Affordances: Provide immediate feedback to user actions to confirm that their interactions are registered. Use visual cues such as animations, tooltips, and progress indicators to indicate the outcome of user actions. Incorporate intuitive affordances to suggest how users can interact with interface elements.
User Assistance and Onboarding: Offer clear instructions and assistance to help users understand how to use the application effectively. Implement onboarding tutorials, tooltips, contextual help, and documentation to onboard new users and support existing ones.
Accessibility: Design the application with accessibility in mind to ensure that users with disabilities can access and use it effectively. Follow accessibility guidelines and standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to make the application inclusive for all users.
Iterative Testing and Improvement: Conduct usability testing with real users throughout the design and development process. Gather feedback, observe user behavior, and iterate on the design to address usability issues and improve the overall user experience.-->
