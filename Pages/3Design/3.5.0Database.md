# Database (WhiteBox)

## Intent/Responsibility
The database's main responibility of managing persistent data for the application can be broken down into two parts: managing settings and managing everything around attendance lists. Settings, students, course, attendance lists, etc. are saved as tables in a relational database.
See the [data dictionary](3.1.0Architecture.md#4-data-handling) for more information.

## Interfaces
The database functionality is provided by `DatabaseClient`. This backend holds the database connection and the data in it can only be accessed through the interface provided by the backend.
The interface of the `DatabaseClient` is passed onto the MVVM interface.

The default MVVM implementation inherits its database functionality from `BackendDatabase`, which is the implementation of `DatabaseClient`.
