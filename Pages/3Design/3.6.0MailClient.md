It also can check the Connection to the mail server.

## Interfaces
The mail client functionality is provided by `MailClient`. This backend fetches and analyzes the mail data and the data in it can only be accessed through the interface provided by the backend.
The interface of the `MailClient` is passed onto the MVVM interface.

The default MVVM implementation inherits its database functionality from `BackendMail`, which is the implementation of `MailClient`.
