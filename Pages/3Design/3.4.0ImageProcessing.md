# Image Processing (WhiteBox)
The image processing submodule is can be broken apart into three functional parts: Finding the table, parsing the table and validating the signatures. Each of these functionalities are handled mostly by a single function, though for those unfamiliar with image processing (and maybe for those familiar with it as well) the steps taken forprocessing the table are not obvious.

|**Functionality**|**Short description**|
|---|---|
|[Finding the table](3.4.1Finding%20the%20Table.md)|The process for locating the table in the image and warping the image s.t. only the list is shown.|
|[Parsing the table](3.4.2Parsing%20the%20Table.md)|The process for extracting the information for the location of cells, the names of the students, and the header of the attendance list. |
|[Validating the Signatures](3.4.3Validating%20the%20Signatures.md)|The process for checking whether a signature field is valid or invalid.|
