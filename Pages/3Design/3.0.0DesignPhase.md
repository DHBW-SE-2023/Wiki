# Design Phase

The design phase of the software development lifecycle is the stage where the blueprint for the software system is created. The goal is to create a comprehensive and coherent plan that guides the implementation process. Effective design ensures that the software meets the desired functionality, performance, and quality standards. It lays the groundwork for development, testing, and deployment, making it a fundamental step in delivering successful software solutions.
