YAAC breaks down in three (OR FOUR???) subsystems as presented below.

Subsystems:

- Mail Integration: Searches all incoming mails for the keywords in the subject and extracts the images
- Image Processing: Analyzes and processes all extracted images and sends output towards the database
- Database: Stores all output data.
- UI(???)

## Mail Integration

### Intent/Responsibility

This subsystem implements the connection with the mail server to intercept the incoming mails amd find the ones relevant to YAAC. The project uses the IMAP protocol. It fetches the incoming mail and checks if the subject includes words like "Liste" (list), "Anwesenheit" (attendance), "Anwesenheitsliste"(attendance list). If that is the case, the attachement of the mail is extracted and sent to the building block image processing.

## Image Processing

### Intend/Responsibility

This subsystem is tasked of extracting the useful information out of an image containing an attendance list.
It finds the attendance list in the image and transforms the image in such a way that the new image only contains the attendance list, showing it from an orthogonal view (See [Perspective Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_projection&oldid=1199861711#Perspective_projection)). 
After finding the attendance list and focusing the image onto the table showing the signatures (from hereon simply refered to by the table) it also has the parsing the table. This means saving the coordinates of the table cells in a virtual table, converting the students' names from an image to text, and validating the signature of each student.

### Interfaces

|**Function**|**Short description**|
|---|---|
|FindTable|Find the table in an image. It warps the image accordingly.|
|PrepareImage|Prepare the image for further use.|
|ParseTable|Parse an image of a table, saving the rows and columns as well as the prepared image.|
|NewTable|Find table, parse it and validate the table[^1].|



|**Method**|**Short description**|
|---|---|
|Review|Review the image of the table, which is expected to be prepared by PrepareImage|

You find details about the Image Processing subsystem in the white box view.

[^1]: These tasks combined into one function, because no part should ever need to execute this "pipeline" on it own, because it might yield a different result than expected.

### Files

The code for this module can be found in `internal/backend/imgproc`.

### Open Issues

- The logic in `FindTable` finds the largest rectangle in an image. For attendance lists printed on white paper and photos taken of it on a white underground is no problem. 
It assumes that the largest rectangle is the table for the signatures.
If the photo is taken on a dark background, the largest rectangle is the attendance sheet and the table can not be parsed correctly.

- The behaviour parsing the table when the image was taken with insufficient lighting was not tested.
