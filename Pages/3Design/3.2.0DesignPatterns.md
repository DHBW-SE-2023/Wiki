# Design Patterns

*Choose your Character*

- Singleton (ensures a class has only one instance, provides a global point of access to it)
- Factory (Provides an interface for creating families of related (or dependant) objects without specifying their concrete classes)
- Strategy (Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable, lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it) - Client kennt Object und Kontext
- Observer (Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically)
- Builder (Encapsulates complex object construction, multistep factory, client needs domain knowledge)
- Adapter (Converts the interface of a class into another interface, lets class work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces)
- State (Allows an object to alter its behavior when an internal state changes, the object will appear to change its class) - Client kennt Zustände nicht
