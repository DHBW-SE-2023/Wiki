- Singleton (ensures a class has only one instance, provides a global point of access to it)
- Factory (Provides an interface for creating families of related (or dependant) objects without specifying their concrete classes)
- Strategy (Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable, lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it) - Client kennt Object und Kontext
- Observer (Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically)
- Builder (Encapsulates complex object construction, multistep factory, client needs domain knowledge)
- Adapter (Converts the interface of a class into another interface, lets class work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces)
- State (Allows an object to alter its behavior when an internal state changes, the object will appear to change its class) - Client kennt ZustÃ¤nde nicht -->

This project mainly relies on the singleton pattern for its MVVM code structure. The MVVM default implementation inherits its functionality from different backends. These backends are singletons that implement different functions, like accessing the database or the mail server. Backends that don't hold data or a connection don't have a backend (like the MVVM default implementation for Image Processing). Any singleton-like data that is required by some backend functionality is also stored in the respective backend (like the handle to the database connection).
