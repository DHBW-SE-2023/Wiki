# Design Patterns

This project mainly relies on the singleton pattern for its MVVM code structure. The MVVM default implementation inherits its functionality from different backends. These backends are singletons that implement different functions, like accessing the database or the mail server. Backends that don't hold data or a connection don't have a backend (like the MVVM default implementation for Image Processing). Any singleton-like data that is required by some backend functionality is also stored in the respective backend (like the handle to the database connection).
