# Architecture
<!--
"Strukturierte oder hieriachische Anordnung der Systemkomponenten sowie Beschreibung ihrer Beziehungen/Softwarearchitektur ist die Summe aller wichtigen Entscheidungen"
Kernfrage: Was soll technisch entwickelt werden?

Basis: Produktanforderungen etc.

-> Festlegung auf eingesetzte Technologien, Schnittstellen, Datenbanktechnologien, HMI Frameworks

Designtreiber (Aspekte die Architektur def.):

- Nicht-funktional: Barrierefreiheit, Migrationsf채higkeit, Performance
- Einsatzbedingungen: Nebenl채ufigkeit, Verteilt, Echtzeitf채hig
- Umgebung: Zielplattform, Betriebssystem, Laufzeitumgebungen
- Qualit채t: Wiederverwendbarkeit, Akzeptable Fehlerraten

Unterteilung in folgende Grundsatzentscheidungen:

## HMI

### Choice of Technology

The goal is to develop a cross-platform application. To make that happen, we use the tool Fyne to create the user interface.

### Synchronization

YAAC checks every 30 minutes whether new emails have arrived. Therefore, the status of the emails is always up to date. The app continues to run in the background, even if it is not open on the desktop screen.

## Distribution

We use a Fat Client as we run everything locally except for the mail integration. A possible add-on could be a cloud-based database integration, which would ensure data integrity as the the data will not be stored on one device only.
<!-- Fat Client, Client/Server, Web Architektur, Service orientierte Architektur, Microservices -->

## Infrastructure

### Operating Systems

<!-- Well, I'd that depends on the final implementation xD -->

The development environment is UNIX. The computer in the secretary's office uses Windows, therefore the final application must be executable on Windows.


### Programming Language

After we tested different programming languages and their compatibility to different frontend tools in the exploration sprints, we decided to use the programming language Go and combine it with the toolkit Fyne. The reasons for that are described in the subdivision [1.6.0 Exploration Sprints](/3rdTry/1PlanningPhase/1.6.0ExplorationSprints.md).

### Frameworks

### Inter Process Communication

### Communication Protocols

The email service implementation works via SMTP and IMAP.

### Safety Aspects

## Data Handling

### Database (XML/JSON/Binary)

The user data are saved in a database using SQLight. The reasons for this decision are described in chapter [1.6.0 Exploration Sprints](/3rdTry/1PlanningPhase/1.6.0ExplorationSprints.md). 

### Local/Central

The database is saved on the computer locally. An optional feature would be to implement the storage on a cloud as it would be better for data integrity.

### Relational Database

The chosen database system is SQLite, which is a relational database.

For faster execution and security against SQL-Injection attacks it is crucial to use prepared statements wherever user input is parsed to an SQL statement. Prepared statements save resources and accept input variables only as values not as part of the sql statement. Their usage is described [here](https://go.dev/doc/database/prepared-statements).

The entity relationship diagram of the database shows a high level overview planned out with everyone involved. It defines all tables (Student, Attendance, AttendanceList), their attributes and their relations needed for the basic program and leaves expandability.

The data dictionary is described in the following:



Course

| attribute name | data type |
| ------- | ------ |
| Name: string
| Students: []Student

---

### Student

| attribute name | data type |
| ------- | ------ |
| FirstName        | string required |
| LastName         | string required |
| CourseID         | uint |
| IsImmatriculated | bool |

---

### Attendance

| attribute name | data type |
| ------- | ------ |
| StudentID        | uint primaryKey |
| AttendanceListID | uint primaryKey |
| IsAttending      | bool |
| NameROI          | Rectangle |
| SignatureROI     | Rectangle |
| TotalROI         | Rectangle |

---

### AttendanceList

| attribute name | data type |
| ------- | ------ |
| CreatedAt    | time.Time, primaryKey |
| UpdatedAt    | time.Time |
| CourseID     | uint foreignKey:Id; references:Course |
| ReceivedAt   | time.Time |
| Attendancies | []Attendance |
| Image        | []byte // image as png |

---

### Setting

| attribute name | data type |
| ------- | ------ |
| Setting | string primaryKey |
| Value   | string |



Date is not a known type to sqlite but is can be represented as text in ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS"). And build-in functions can produce such strings.

<!-- ### Object Oriented Database - not the case in our project --> 

### Backup/Replication

There is no backup database in the current project plan for YAAC. The images still would exist in the user's email inbox. The absent students have to be noted on a university owned system, therefore this part of the data would be saved as well. In conclusion a backup would be recommendable, but it's not required, which makes this aspect optional.
