# Work Package Plan / Product Backlog

Creation of singular work packages based on [requirement specification](/3rdTry/1Planningphase/1.2RequirementSpecification.md)

Each Work Package is described through:

## Index

- defined result
- effort
- preconditions
- duration

Dependencies between work packages logically create a network diagram.

-> sequential processing necessary -> critical project path

-> possibility of parallelization



## Template for User Stories

The specifications have to answer the following questions:
- What features must the product have?
- What features are desirable?
- How will the product be used?
- What are the quality requirements for the product?
- How is the user interface defined?
- What are the technical constraints of the product?
must be met?
- What sub-products are planned?
