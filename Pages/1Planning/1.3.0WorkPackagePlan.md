# Work Package Plan / Product Backlog

<!--
Creation of singular work packages based on [requirement specification](/3rdTry/1Planningphase/1.2RequirementSpecification.md)

Each Work Package is described by:

- defined result
- effort
- preconditions
- duration

Dependencies between work packages logically create a network diagram.

-> sequential processing necessary -> critical project path

-> possibility of parallelization
-->

The work packages can be viewed on the Kanban board of the git project YAAC liked [here](https://github.com/orgs/DHBW-SE-2023/projects/1). The standard duration of development is one week. If this time period was not enough, it was extended for another week and commented in the affected work packages.

The sprint workflow in which we processed the work packages was as the following state machine diagram shows.

## Template for User Stories

The specifications have to answer the following questions:
- What features must the product have?
- What features are desirable?
- How will the product be used?
- What are the quality requirements for the product?
- How is the user interface defined?
- What are the technical constraints of the product?
must be met?
- What sub-products are planned?
