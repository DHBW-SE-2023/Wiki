## Burndownchart
To keep a more detailed track of our current progress, we'll split up the roadmap milestones into their seperate features. 
This will give us more precise information about whether we are on track or not during our sprint meetings. 

Therefore we'll assign all issues to their milestone so that we can track how many features/issues have to be done each month.
