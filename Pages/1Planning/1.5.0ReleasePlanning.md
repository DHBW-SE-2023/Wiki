# Release Planning

<!--
"A release plan is a detailed description of the planned features, enhancements, and fixes to be included in a specific version of software or a product. A release plan may vary depending on the specific requirements of a project, but typically includes the following:

- Release Objectives: A clear definition of the goals and purpose of the release. This could include introducing new features, improving user experience, or fixing bugs.
- Feature List: A detailed list of all features to be included in this release. Each feature should have a brief description and priorities.
- Timeline: A schedule indicating when the release is planned for publication. This could be a specific date or a timeframe, such as the fourth quarter of the year.
- Resource Planning: Information about the resources needed for the development and release of the software, including personnel, budget, and infrastructure.
- Risk Assessment: An assessment of potential risks and challenges that could affect the release, along with strategies for risk mitigation.
- Testing and Validation Strategy: A description of the planned testing and validation activities to ensure that the release meets requirements and quality standards.
- Communication Plan: A plan for communicating with relevant stakeholders, including customers, internal teams, and external partners, about the progress and release of the software.
- Documentation: A guide or documentation to help users understand and use the new features.
- Feedback Mechanisms: Mechanisms for capturing feedback from users after the release to inform improvements for future versions.
- Change Tracking: A system for tracking changes during the development process to ensure that the release meets requirements and specifications.

These elements are crucial to ensure that a release is successfully planned, developed, and published and meets the requirements of users and stakeholders."

Therefore: Some sort of conclusion of the Planning Phase?
