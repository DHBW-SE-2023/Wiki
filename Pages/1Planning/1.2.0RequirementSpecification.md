## Automated Attendance Tracking: Improving Administrative Efficiency at the DHBW Friedrichshafen

Currently, the attendance check for each course at the DHBW Friedrichshafen is carried out via a written list of participants. Each student must sign their name on the relevant line of the given table. The completed lists are then sent to the secretary's office by designated students. Each list is checked manually for completeness and if a student's signature is missing, the secretary waits until the end of the class to then mark that student as missing for the day. This process has to be repeated until every list was sent and checked individually. This laborious process consumes a lot of administrative time.

To address this challenge, we are developing a comprehensive full-stack application th automate and therefore to optimize the workflow of the attendance checks for the secretary's office. Our application's primary goal is to provide a seamless and efficient solution for tracking attendance, thus enhancing the overall administrative efficiency at DHBW Friedrichshafen.

### Most important Features:

### Email Integration
YAAC automates the attendance tracking process for each course and therefore eliminates the need for manual verification of student signatures.
The application automatically captures the attendance lists from the mailbox in a 30 minute interval, eliminating the need for constantly checking the mails manually and thereby enabling a close to real time attendance monitoring. That allows users to quickly identify missing students and take appropriate action.
The integration of YAAC should be easy and assimilated with the already existing tracking system. There should not be a hinderance towards the new technology as it barely changes the workflow of all attendance checks but optimizes it.

### Image Processing

The identified image of an attendance list will be extracted from the mail and analyzed. YAAC will recognize the names on the list and whether there is the student's signature in place. It sends the extracted information to the our applications database.

### Database

The application includes its own database, ensuring both data protection regulations and the security and confidentiality of student attendance records. Users can browse through the history of attendance lists, simplifying 

### User Interface

YAAC features a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to use. With straightforward navigation and clear instructions, users can effortlessly manage attendance records and track student participation. It is customizationable: The application allows users to add lists to YAAC directly over the user interface if needed. If the necessity arises, the user can also resolve mistakes or add changes manually over the UI.
